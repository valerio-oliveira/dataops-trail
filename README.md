## Presentation

This project is a landmark on my career as a DataOps Engineer, a role that I didn't even know that exists one week ago and pushed me to decide to learn and embrace the DevOps practices and tools: concepts that I know from my coleagues of a DevOps squad close to me.

Just to mention my previous experience before taking this chalenge, appart from being a database administrator I am a software developer, and I've recently achieved the Azure AZ-900 and DP-900 certifications, both giving me a general understanding of cloud computing.

## Project description

I started my learning path by writing a simple Python + Django API, and I've mounted a Docker image with it. The application is able to access a PostgreSQL database on a different Host.

My most recent step was learning to use Terraform, and both the application host and the database host are now provisioned on the AWS cloud, in different EC2 instances but at the same availability zone. I chose to use a modular aproach for the Terraform project, once this is considered the best practice for companies with multiple teams using the IaaS tool.

So far, it took me most of the week strugling to provision my VMs. I figured out later that among my many mistakes, also a default subnet has to be created for my brand new AWS account's vpc.

Now, it is time to use Ansible for provisioning, configuring and deploying my API and PostgreSQL. The learning courve for Ansible is surprisingly low. Learning and applying the PostgreSQL instalation, the database creation, and set up is taking few hours.

### Next steps

My first step as soon as the application gets operational, will be setting up a high availability sollution, replicating the environment to a different Region. so, I'll setup a pipeline using either Github Actions or Jenkins. This seems to be a core feature of the whole process.

Then, as a way to achieve low latency on database requests, I will refactor the persistence level of the API, and make use of Redis in-memory database.

After that, it will be time to move the API to a Kubernetes cluster, getting able to scale my API. As my final step, I will set up queue controlling using either RabitMQ, Celery, or Apache Kafka.

Wish me luck!

```

Installing Docker

```shell
❯ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
❯ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo "$UBUNTU_CODENAME") stable"
❯ sudo apt update

❯ curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
❯ sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
❯ sudo apt install terraform
```

Installing Ansible

```shell
❯ python -m pip install --user ansible
❯ python -m pip install --user paramiko
❯ sudo apt install software-properties-common
❯ sudo apt install ansible
```

---

## Application environment

On the root folder of the hometastproject project, just create an ".env" file and paste the content above in it. Then, follow the hints in order to fill the variables values.

IMPORTANT! Be careful on not adding any space between the equal sign and the value of each variable.

> .env
>
> ```py
> # ------------
> # django
> # ------------
> # Replace the content of the string with the secret key of your own Django "settings.py" file.
> SECRET_KEY='django-insecure-wak-...'
>
> # ------------
> # database
> # ------------
> # Set the credentials for the PostgreSQL database
> host=             # IP or DNS of the database Host
> port=             # (default 5432)
> database=         # Database name
> user=             # Role name
> password=         # Database role password
> application_name=Birthday Application
> ```

## Dockerizing

The steps bellow shall be tak0en in the API project's directory.

> Dockerfile
>
> ```docker
> FROM python:3
>
> WORKDIR /usr/src/app
> COPY requirements.txt ./
> RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
>
> COPY . .
>
> CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:80"]
> ```

Building an image named "api"

```shell
❯ docker build -t api .
```

If all the application's dependencies were declared on the "requirements.txt" file, the new image will be creasted.

In order to test the application, the next step will be running a container.

Running a container named "capi"

```shell
❯ docker run --name capi -d -p 80:80 --net host api
```

Eliminating the container

```shell
❯ docker rm -f capi
```

Destroying the image

```shell
❯ docker rmi api
```

## Terraformation

As I keep learning, I've changes the Terraform project a couple of times. The main setback here was learning the networking concepts. Now, Terraform project creates the environment in two different regions. The model wirks as

Set the following variables which will be user by Terrafor.

> variables.auto.tfvars
>
> ```terraform
> application_ports    = [22, 80]
> database_ports    = [22, 5432]
> ansible_directory = "../../ansible/inventories"
>
> ```

The steps bellow shall be taken in the "aws" directory.

At the first time running a Terraform project, Terraform has to be initialized.

Initializing

```shell
❯ terraform init
```

Plannning

```shell
❯ terraform plan -out "revolut_plan"
```

Applying

```shell
❯ terraform apply "revolut_plan"
```

Destroying

```shell
❯ terraform destroy
```

---

## Ansible in action

Despite provisioning both VM and applications can be done using only either Terraform or Ansible, it is a good practice to create VMs using Terraform, and using Ansible for installing and configuring the cloud applications.

Setting up .pem file to access to the remote hosts

> /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
>
> ```shell
> # Add the path of your .PEM file.
> private_key_file = /path/my_pem_file.pem
>
> # Enable this param in order to avoid issues
> allow_world_readable_tmpfiles=true
> ```

Environment variables

> vars.yml
>
> ```yml
> postgresql_version: 14 # PostgreSQL version
> postgresql_host_ip: # The internal IP
> postgresql_port: 5432 # PostgreSQL port
> postgresql_db_name: # The database name
> postgresql_db_user: # The database user's name
> postgresql_db_user_password: # The database user's password
>
> application_name: Birthday API
> ```

> ansible.cfg
>
> ```yml
> [defaults]
> host_key_checking = false
> remote_user = admin
> ask_pass = false
> private_key_file = /.../my_pem_file.pem # path of your pem file
> roles_path = /.../ansible/roles/ #Your roles folder path
> [privilege_escalation]
> become = true
> become_method = sudo
> become_user = admin # Your remote user
> become_ask_pass = false
> ```
